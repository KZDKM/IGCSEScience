	Osmosis: diffusion of water molecules
	
	
	
	
	
<h2 id="B3">B3 Biomolecules</h2>

Biomolecules is simply **organic molecules** found in living organisms

**What is organic compound?**
>Organic compounds is compounds containing carbon, but **not** carbonate or carbon oxides.
	
Biomolecules are usually polymers: large molecules in chain
Monomer: single units that composes the larger polymer

- Usual functionality of biomolecules:

	1. Providing energy
	2. Storing information (DNA and RNA)
	3. Acting as catalysts (basically enzymes)

- Reactions of biomolecules:

	1. Condensation
			Two or more monomers reacts and forms covalent bond together with water, forming a polymer
	2. Hydrolysis
			Covalent bond of hydrated polymer is broken into two monomers, each bonding with a OH
			
**Typical biomolecules:** Carbohydrates, Fats, Protein
All composed of C,H,O,N,P

<h2 id="B4">B4 Enzymes</h2>

Enzyme is a biological catalyst, it speeds up some reaction, its protein, therefore it would be denatured at high temperature, and denaturation is permanent.


The shape of enzyme fits the reactant, since it have to fit the reactant, it has an **active site**, which is the only side that could adapt to and fits the reactant.
	
- **Optimum temperature for enzyme activity:**








	<img src="https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/aw-05_aw12.15b9eda331a06af02c83.png?w=1000&auto=compress">
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
- **Optimum pH level for enzymes is another story**

	Its different for every enzymes
	
	
<h2 id="B5">B5 Plant Nutrition</h2>

- **Photosynthesis**

	- Photosynthesis is the primary source of energy for plants, it takes carbon dioxide and water and light to make glucose and oxygen as a biproduct
	- Photosynthesis is done in chlorophyll in plant cells
	- Adaptation characteristics of plants for photosynthesis:
	
		1. Thin leaves: allow chlorophyll to absorb more lights, and diffusion distance of CO2 made short
		2. Large surface area for leaf: allow the plants to take in more sunlight and CO2
		3. Stomata: entrance and exit for CO2 and oxygen
		4. Xylem and phloem: supply water to cells and transport products of photosynthesis
		5. Stem and leaf stalks: hold leaves at the right angle to absorb as much sunlight as possible
		6. Large surface area of root hair cells: larger surface to absorb more nutrients in soil
	- Different chemical energy form in plants:
		- Sucrose for transportation of energy within plants, starch for storage of energy within plants
	
- **Leaf Structure**

	- **Parts:**
		- Chloroplasts: Located on the upper part  Contain chlorophylls for photosynthesis
		- Waxy cuticle: Located on the top part of the leaf, stops water from evaporating from the top
		- Stomata: Small openings located under the leaf
		- Upper and lower epidermis: inner layer of cells, upper epidermis doesn’t contain chloroplast, lower epidermis do contain chloroplast
		- Palisade mesophyll: Upper layer of closed packed cells that have large amount of chloroplast
		- Spongy mesophyll:  middle layer of cells that are loosely spaced that allows diffusion of gases
		- Xylem: Carries water from roots to the leaves
		- Phloem: Carries sucrose away from the leaf
		- Vascular bundles: Contains xylem and phloem cells, located within the spongy mesophyll
		
- **The roles and importance of minerals**
	- **Nitrate** and **Magnesium** ions are absorbed into the plants from the soil
		- Nitrates contains nitrogen, essential for composing amino acids, and producing proteins, which is vital for plants
		- Magnesium is essential for the synthesis of chlorophyll, therefore its important for plants
	

<h2 id="B6">B6 Animal Nutrition</h2>

- **Types of animal / human nutrition**
	- Carbs - short term energy supply
	- Proteins - building blocks, used for repair and growth of body
	- Fats - long term storage of energy, fat contains two times the energy comparing to the same amount of carbs
	- Vitamin C - growth and repair
	- Vitamin D - absorption of calcium
	- Calcium - strengthen bones and teeth, helps with muscle contraction and nerve transmission
	- Iron - Production of RBC
	- Water - transports thought the body, made up 60% of human body
	
	
	
<h2 id="B7">B7.1 Transports in Plants</h2>

1. **Water**

	- Xylem in plants is for transporting water in plants, it also supports the stem of the plants, xylem are made of lignin, which is very strong
Root hair cells have large surface area to take in water and minerals from soil
	- Transpiration
		- Plant lose water by evaporation, the evaporated water is released from the stomata
		- Plant leaves have large area, allowing the water in mesophyll to be evaporated
		- The interconnecting air spaces creates an concentration gradient
		- There are many stomata for water to diffuse out of the leaf
		- **Rate of transpiration is affected by:**
			- Temperature
			- Humidity(if the water potential outside the plant are already high, osmosis wont move water outward)
			- Wind speed
			- Light intensity
			- Water supply
	
##B7.2 Transports in Animals

- **Cardiovascular system**

	- Three types of blood vessels
		- Artery: carries oxygenated blood
		- Vein: carries deoxygenated blood
		- Capillary: small vessels delivering blood to body tissues
		- Artery vs Vein
			- Artery have thick and smooth wall, blood pressure in artery is higher than pressure in vein
			- Vein's wall are thinner than artery, wall of vein are made of single layer of cells
	- The *"Pump"*: Heart
	
	- **Double circulatory system**
		- Mammals have double circulatory system, it contains both **pulmonary circulation** and **systemic circulation**
			- Pulmonary circulation:
				- Between heart and lungs
				- Pulmonary arteries carries deoxygenated blood from heart to lungs
				- Pulmonary vein carries oxygenated blood from lungs to heart
			- Systemic circulation
				- Between heart and the whole body
				- Systemic arteries carries oxygenated blood to the rest of the body
				- Systemic veins carries deoxygenated blood from the rest of the body to heart
	- The structure of heart

	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
		<img src="https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_143/content_uploads/aw09_aw06.f6230069d543acd0a5ea.png?w=800&auto=compress">
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	- Other vessels:
		- Vena cava lets the deoxygenated blood flow back to heart
		- Aorta takes oxygenated from the heart to arteries
		- Renal artery is the blood supply from heart to kidney
		- Renal vein takes blood from the kidney to vena cava, then returned to heart
		- Arteriole is the small arteries that branches off from artery to capillary
		- Venule takes deoxygenated blood from the capillaries to back to vein
	- **Coronary artery disease**
		- Coronary artery are vessels that supplies the **Cardiac muscle**, its thin and easy to be clotted by fats, coronary disease is caused by this, it could lead to heart attack, high animal fat consumption and high salt consumption could lead to coronary heart disease, also, cigarettes could increase the chance of getting coronary heard disease, since a major ingredient for cigarette is nicotine, it could damage the circulatory system, eventually leading to coronary heart disease
	- Transport in blood
		- What's in the blood?
			- Blood are made of blood cells and plasma, for cells, there is red blood cells and white blood cells, and platelets, red blood cells are responsible for oxygen transport, and white blood cells are part of the immune system, platelets are important because it turns blood into clots when there is bleeding (once come in contact with air), plasma is mostly water, nutrients and hormones, and carbon dioxide are dissolved in it
			
<h2 id="B8">B8 Gas Exchange and respiration</h2>
	
- **Gas in lungs**
	- Gas goes into mouth or nostril into larynx, and trachea, then bronchi, and bronchioles into alveoli, then diffuses into capillaries
	- Contraction of diaphragm enlarges lungs and negative pressure in lung pushes air in, then diaphragm is relaxed, lungs are shrunk, pushing air out
- **Protection for the respiratory system**
	- Goblet cells, mucus, and ciliated cells removes pathogens and particles from the respiratory system, Goblet cells produces mucus, ciliated cells pushes particles out of the respiratory system, mucus catches particles that are going into the lungs
Diseases in respiratory system
	- Diseases
		- **Bronchitis**
			- Smoking could cause multiple respiratory diseases, one is bronchitis, tobacco smoke is hot, the hot smoke going into bronchi could damage the cilia, making it vulnerable to particles, and with insufficient functioning cilia, respiratory system produces more mucus to protect it, resulting in mucus to accumulate in lungs, and affect normal breathing
		- **Emphysema**
			- Smoke contains carbon particles, carbon particles could sticks in alveoli, white blood cells would try to remove those carbon particles by secreting chemical substances, however, those chemical substances could damage the alveoli itself also, and as more carbon particles accumulate, alveoli gets more damaged, and there will be less surface area for gas exchange to take place, or even make the alveoli not work at all
			- Also, smokes contain carbon monoxide, it bonds with the hemoglobin (red blood cells) and make it malfunction, as more hemoglobin gets damaged, insufficient oxygen are delivered around the body
	
- **Aerobic respiration:** glucose + oxygen -> carbon dioxide + water
- **Anaerobic respiration:** glucose -> lactic acid

<h2 id="B9">B9 Coordination and homeostasis</h2>

- **Nervous system:** the nervous system is made of two parts, one is the **CNS** (Central Nervous System) another is the **PNS** (Peripheral Nervous System), Central nervous system is basically brain and the spinal cord, and PNS is nerves that spreads around the rest of the body
	
- **Neurons:** neuron are the cells that composes the nerves as individual cells, just like other specialized cells, it has different parts:
	- Nucleus
	- Axon carries impulse **away** from the cell
	- Dendrites accepts impulses and **carry** it toward the cell
	- Nerve ending only exists in motor neuron which connects to muscles and make it move
- **Types of neurons**
	- Sensory neuron
	- Relay neuron
	- Motor neuron
	
- **Reflexes**: reflex is the natural human response toward a stimuli, brain is not involved in the reflex action
	- Parts of reflexes:
		- **Receptor:** parts that detects the stimulus
		- **Sensory neuron** which receives the stimulus
		- **Relay neuron** which carries the impulse to the spinal cord
		- **Motor neuron** which finally carries the impulse to the muscle or glands
		- **Effector** which is the muscle or gland which performs the action as the output of a reflex
- **The eye**
	- Pupil: ring of muscles that controls the amount of light entering the eye
	- Cones: captures colored light, but does not function with low intensity of light
	- Rods: captures the intensity of light, works under environments with low intensity of light
	- Retina: layers of light receptors on the inner part of the eyes
	- Lens: a jelly like structure to refract entering light onto the retina
	- Suspensory ligament: holds the lens in place and stretch it
	- Cornea: the white, rigid part of the eye, provides physical protection
	- Optical nerve: the nerve that carries elecric impulse signals toward the brain

<h2 id="B11">B11 Inheritance</h2>

- **Chromosomes**
	- Chromosomes are threads of DNA which carries genetic information
	- In body cells, there is normally 23 pairs of chromosomes
	- The 22nd chromosome is X, 23rd chromosomes is X or Y, those are sex chromosomes
		- Male have XY
		- Female have XX
		- Egg cells only contain X chromosome
		- Sperm could contain either X or Y chromosome
	- Genotypes
		- When two sex cells combine, the chromosome are taken within a pair in two cells and combined like this:  
		 	
			   		 | X  | x
				----|----|----
			  **X** | XX | Xx
			  **x** | Xx | xx

		- Dominant genotype: Capitalized letters, if one dominant genotype exists, the gene would result just as that genotype
		- Recessive genotype: small letters, only result as a valid genotype if two of the chromosome are both recessive
		- Homozygous: contain either both dominant or both recessive
		- Heterozygous: contain both dominant and recessive
	- Phenotypes
		- The physical representation of genes
			- Hair color
			- Skin color
			- …
	- **Mutation**
		- Sudden change in genes caused by external factors

<h2 id="B12">B12 Organisms and their environments</h2>

- **Energy flow**
	- Source of all energy in the food chain - sun light
	- Plants utilizes energy delivered by sunlight to produce food and survive
	- When animal eats plants, the energy is absorbed and the energy flows up the food chain
	- The food chain usually contain two to five organisms
		- Producers
		- Primary consumers (herbivore: plant eaters)
		- Secondary consumers (carnivore: animal/meat eaters)
		- Tertiary consumers
		- Quaternary consumers
		- Decomposers (feeds on dead bodies of all above, which is also a consumer, but could be consumed by plants)
	- All those groups mentioned above are called trophic levels
	- Trophic level increases as it flows up the food chain
	- A food chain must include a producer
	- The transformation of energy is not total, as the energy flows up the food chain, it only keep 90% of the total amount of energy going up each level

<h2 id="B13">B13 Human influences on the ecosystem</h2>

- **The carbon cycle**
	- Photosynthesis
		- Plants take carbon from the atmosphere and produce glucose (the ONLY way that carbons could leave the atmosphere)
	- Respiration
		- Plants and animals perform respiration, as their cell activity releases carbon dioxide and released into atmosphere
	- Feeding
		- Feeding of plants and animals also transfers carbon
	- Decomposition
		- Dead bodies of plants and animals gets decomposed and the carbon dioxides are released back into atmosphere
	- Fossilization
		- If the dead body gets buried, high temperatures and pressure turns it into fossil fuels, which could be used to combust
	- Combustion
		- Combustion of fossil fuels releases carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide back into atmosphere
	
	- Human impact on the carbon cycle
		- The carbon cycle affected if any stage of carbon cycle is altered, human impact on carbon cycle by photosynthesis could be killing plants by a large quantity(cutting trees), or increased combustions of fossil fuels, those all contributes to the increased carbon level in the atmosphere

- **Deforestation**
	- Deforestation, massive amount of loss of trees caused by artificial factors, could harm the environment in multiple ways:
		- Species extinction
			- As the local ecosystem could be heavily relied on trees, absence of trees around the area could affect the population of other species around the area as most of them relies on trees and could not adapt to such large change in the environment
		- Soil erosion
			- Trees have large and long extending roots, which supports them and hold them in place, it also provides support for soils, if trees died out in an area, soil would lose its support, therefore eroding, turning into dust storms or being carried by waters
		- Flooding
			- If the soil is deformed, the water cycle is likely to be affected, as there would be less restrictions of water flows, which could eventually results in flooding
		- Increased CO2 (mentioned above)
Water pollution

- **Chemical wastes**
	- The pollution of water by chemical could cause fatal effects on the entire local ecosystem, since the whole ecosystem relies on water for drinking, and consumption of aquatic animals which were active around the polluted area could spread the chemical pollution in the water around and up the food chain
- **Discarded rubbish**
	- Discarded rubbish could harm marine life as they could mistake rubbishes as foods
- **Untreated sewage**
	- Untreated sewages contains harmful bacteria, as they are released into ocean or rivers, the large scale of bacterial activity around the area could decrease the oxygen level in the water, leaving other organisms with limited supplies
- **Fertilizers**
	- Fertilizers releasing into water could massively increase the amount of microorganisms as they consume the nutrients in the fertilizers, those large groups of organisms floating on the surface of water could block the sunlight passing under the water, many organisms that relies on sunlight would die off, and as the nutrients depletes, the large group of micro organisms dies off also, leaving decomposers a massive amount of consumables, increase of activity of decomposition leads to oxygen to run off and more organisms dying
	- The massive increase of nutrition supply is called ***eutrophication***
	
<h2 id="C2">C2 Experimental techniques</h2>

- **Solvent**
	- Things to dissolve in (e.g. water)
- **Solute**
	- Things that’s dissolved (e.g. salt)
	
- **Methods of purification**
	- Filtration
		- Very simple technique to separate an INSOLUBLE solid from a liquid, filter paper is used for separation of fine particles
	- Crystallization
		- Crystallization is a separation technique which requires boiling of liquid solvent to extract solutes from the solvent which are yet to evaporate because of the difference in boiling points, it is cooled down and crystallizes into solids
	- Distillation
		- Distillation is used to separate multiple substances which have different boiling points, as the temperature increases, substances with lower boiling point gets boiled first, it is then cooled down and condensed into liquid to be collected, repeats those steps with gradual increment of temperature would achieve separation of substances with different boiling points
	- Paper chromatography
		- Paper chromatography could be used as a separation technique, papers could separate different chemicals which could then be washed off the paper


<h2 id="C4">C4 Stoichiometry</h2>

**For Stoichiometry there is only these things to memorize:** 
 
1. ***The Avogadro constant***  

	> ***6.02 × 10^(23)***
	- The amount of particle/atoms in 12g of carbon-12
	1 mole of substance = (The Avogadro constant) 6.02 × 10^(23) molecules of substance
	- Relative atomic/molecular mass/mass number in grams = mass of one mole of substance
2. ***Molar gas volume***
	- Under same temperature and pressure, the same volume of gas could contain a equal number of molecules, no matter what the gas is
	- Number of moles = gas volume / 24

<h2 id="C5">C5 Electricity and chemistry</h2>

- **Electrolysis**
	- Electrolysis is for breaking down of an ionic compound, by the passage of electricity and the attraction of charged matters
	- Components of electrolysis

		- Positive electrode: Anode
		- Negative electrode: Cathode
		- ***PANIC*** (Positive Anode n' Negative Cathode)
		- An electrolyte (molten or aqueous ionic compound to be broken down)
	- Reduction: gaining of election/decrease in charge
	- Oxidation: losing of electron/increase in charge
	- Positive ions are attracted to the negative cathode
	- Negative ions are attracted to the positive anode
	
	- Reactivity series (increasing)

<h2 id="C6">C6 Energy changes in chemical reactions</h2>

- **Exothermic reaction:** releases energy *(temperature increase)*
- **Endothermic reaction:** absorbs energy *(temperature decrease)*
- **Bond energy**
	- Energy is released when new bonds is formed
	- Energy is absorbed when bonds are broken
- **Activation energy:** energy needed to initiate certain reaction

<h2 id="C7">C7 Chemical reaction</h2>

**Rate of reaction**  
> How does reaction occur?
> Collision of molecules.
> The harder the better.

Therefore,  

- Factors that affect rate of reaction
	- +Concentration = Rate+ (More particles)
	- -Particle size = +Surface area = Rate+ (More particle could come in contact with other particles)
	- +Temperature = Rate+ (Faster movement of molecules = Harder collision of molecules)
	- Usage of catalyst = Rate+ (At optimum temperature for the specific catalyst)
Redox reactions
- Oxidation = gain of oxygen = loss of election
- Reduction = loss of oxygen = gain of electron
- ***OILRIG*** (Oxidation is loss of electron, Reduction is gain of electron)
- Reducing and Oxidizing agents
	- Reducing agents are simply molecule that’s been though reduction during the reaction
	- Same applies for Oxidizing agent
	
<h2 id="C8">C8 Acid Bases and Salts</h2>

**Acid and Bases are chemical opposite**
	
- **Definition of acid and bases**
	- ***Acids are proton (hydrogen ion) donor, and bases are proton(hydrogen ion) acceptor***
		- Acid give out hydrogen ions in reactions
		- Base takes hydrogen ions in reactions
- **pH level**
	- pH level: A property of substances that is represented by integers 0-14
	- Lower the pH level, more acidic a substance is
	- Higher the pH level, more basic it is
	- Alkaline
		- If a base dissolves in water, then its alkaline
		- Alkaline is a category of base substances
		- Therefore, a alkaline is always base, a base could be alkaline
Indicators
	- pH levels could be tested with different indicators

- **Reaction of acid and bases**
	- Salt: ionic compounds made of positive ion and negative ions (???)
	- Acid + metal -> salt + hydrogen
	- Acid + metal oxide(base) -> salt + water (neutralization: two chemical opposite, acid and base reacts together to form products with neutral pH level)
	- Acid + metal hydroxide(base) -> salt + water (neutralization)
	- Acid + ammonia solution(base) -> salt + water (neutralization)
	- Acid + Metal carbonate -> salt + carbon dioxide + water
	
- **Types of oxides**
	- Basic oxides/metallic oxides, oxides with metal, and are basic, duh (CaO, MgO)
	- Acidic oxides, oxides with non-metal, and are acidic (SO2)
	- Neutral oxides (Carbon monoxides, dinitrogen oxide, nitrous oxide, nitrogen monoxide)
	- Amphoteric oxide, oxides that could act as both acid and base
- **Preparation of salts**
	- General Procedure/method
		1. Warm the acid to speed the reaction
		2. Add metal, metal oxide or metal carbonate in while stirring the acid
		3. Filter the mixture to remove extra solid materials
		4. Pour the leftovers into evaporating dishes and heat, stop once the crystal started to form
		5. Cool it down
		6. Filter to retrieve the crystals from the liquid
		7. And there is your salts.

<h2 id="C14">C14 Organic Chemistry</h2>
	
- **Names of compounds**
	- **Alkane**
		- Alkane features a single bond between carbons
		- Its functional group is Carbon
		- Each side of carbon is bonded with hydrogen
		- Therefore alkane is saturated, meaning that the compound is hard to be broken down
	
	- **Alkene**
		- Alkene features a double bond between carbons
		- Since it needs to have a double bond between carbons, there is no "methene" (one carbon alkene)
		- Functional group is still Carbon
		- Alkene is not saturated because of the double bond
	- **Alcohol**
		- Alcohol features single bonds between carbons, but have one OH as a functional group
		
	- Prefixes (you only need to memorize the first four actually)
	
		Prefix | Number of carbons 
		-------|------------------	
		Meth-  | 1
		Eth-   | 2 
		Prop-  | 3
		But-   | 4
		Penta- | 5
		Hex-   | 6
		Hept-  | 7
		Octa-  | 8 
		Dec-   | 9
		Dodec- | 10
	
- **Fuel**
	- Types of fuels
		- Coal
		- Natural gas
			- Natural gas is mainly methane
			- Equation for the combustion of Natural Gas:
				- Methane + Oxygen -> Carbon Dioxide + Water
		- Petroleum
			- Fractional Distillation
				> Petroleum, crude oil, consists of different compounds, organic compound-Hydrocarbon, 30% of alkanes, with the remainder of other compounds, this mixture of all those compounds altogether could not be effectively utilized, therefore a separation technique that will separate the crude oil into pure substances, called Fractional Distillation is invented
				- The process of Fractional Distillation: 
					- Crude oil is boiled then released into the distillation tower
					- The temperature have a decreasing trend going up the tower
					- Each temperature point have a layer of condensing surfaces,
					- Where the temperature of the material drops below its boiling point and the material is condensed into liquids
					- The leftover material which have a slightly lower boiling point continue to flow upwards to the colder area to be condensed
					- This separates the substances by their boiling points
				- Products
					- 350C - 600C Bitumen (used for roads and roofing)
					- 250C - 350C Diesel fuels (for trucks that have diesel engine)
					- 60C - 100C Random chemicals (Naphtha for example, are used as base for many chemicals
					- 40C - 100C Petrol (gasoline)
					- <40C Gas 
	

- **Homologous series**
	- Homologous series is a series of compound that have similar chemical properties but each differs from each other from addition of more functional groups.
	- General formula of a typical homologous series: **Alkanes:**  C^(n)H^(2n)+2

- **Alkanes**
	- Alkane is a common hydrocarbon, the chain length differs its usage, its mainly used for fuels
	- Trend of properties in the series
		- Going up the series (Meth-Eth-Pro)
			- Chain length+, Numbers on carbon+
			- Boiling point+, since the molecular mass is higher going up the series
			- Physical state: From gas to liquid cuz duh
	- Alkanes is strong since its mainly composed of C-H covalent bonds, but it still undergoes combustion
		> Methane + 2O^2 -> CO^2 + 2H^(2)O (exothermic)
	- Again, bonds are strong in alkanes compounds, meaning this type on compound is saturated, Each molecules are bond by single bonds
- **Cracking**
	- Heating Ethane would break Ethane down to Ethene and Hydrogen
	- However, since the C-H covalent bond is a strong bond, it would require massive amount of thermal energy to break it down
	- Heating to high temperatures are often expensive, therefore an alternative approach is Catalytic cracking, instead of heating Ethane to 800C, adding aluminum as a catalyst could allow cracking at only 500C
	- Heating cracking and Catalytic cracking are used for different scenarios, Heating cracking are often used in long chains of alkanes
- Saturation
	- Alkenes are unsaturated because of the double bond, its likely to react with halogens, we could utilize this property to test for test for the existence of alkene, when alkene is reacted with Bromide(common halogen), it turns from a brown solution to colorless solution
- **Alcohol**
	- Fermentation
		- Fermentation is the process of making alcohol by breaking down glucose with yeast
			> Glucose -> ethanol + carbon dioxide
	- Hydration of ethene
		- C^(2)H^(4) +  H^(2)O -> C^(2)H^(5)OH
		- Ethene + water -> Ethanol
	- Properties of ethanol
		- Ethanol is small and light molecules that’s liquid at room temp. easy to evaporate and highly flammable and ignited at temperature lower than room temp. combusts with oxygen
	- Use of ethanol
		- Ethanol is only toxic at large scale consumption, and its highly volatility, therefore its used as solvents for cosmetics and perfumes
		- Ethanol could also be used as fuels, leftover crops could be processed to produce ethanol
		
- **Polymers**
	- Single unit of substance = monomer
	- Multiple units joined together = polymer
	- Common polymers
		- PVC
			- Series of polyvinyl chloride
		- Starch
			- Series of glucose
- **Synthetic polymers**
	- Manufacture of polythene
		- Alkenes are important in the manufactures of polythene because its unsaturated and easy to bond with other molecules

<h2 id="P4">P4 Properties of waves (light and sound)</h2>

- **What r waves?**
	- Center: source of disturbance 
	- Peak of waves: crest
	- Low point of waves: trough
	- Types of wave
		- Transverse - up and down
		- Longitudinal - back and forth
	- Wavelength
		- the distance between two crests or two trough or any two equally spaced points on two cycles of wave
	- Frequency
		- number of complete wave pass one point each second = numbers of waves / time
	- Wave speed
		- wavelength * frequency
	- Reflection of wave
		- angle of incidence = angle of reflection
	- Refractive index
		- When a wave enters a denser medium it slows down, and the wave is diverted towards the normal
		- When a wave enters a less dense medium it speeds up, and the wave is diverted away from the normal
		- Refractive index is the ratio of speed of light in vacuum and speed of light in a medium
			- Therefore, Refractive index = speed of light in vacuum / speed of light in a medium
			- Also, Refractive index = sin(angle of incidence) / sin(angle of refraction)
		- Total internal reflection
			- Critical angle
				- If the angle of incidence is larger than the critical angle, then the light penetrates the surface it hits on, otherwise its completely reflected
				- Refractive index = 1 / sin(critical angle)
				- Sin(Critical angle) = 1 / refractive index
		- Ray graphing
			- Optical axis
				- The line on the graph that represents the path of a ray
			- Principal focus
				- The point of intersection of rays refracted by converging lens
			- Focal length
				- The distance of the center of the lens to the principal focus point
- **EM Waves**
	- Order of spectrum (LONG WAVELENGTH -> SHORT WAVELENGTH)
		- Radiowaves
			- Can be send over great distance
			- Refracted back on the top of the atmosphere so it actually travels tru the curvature of the earth
		- Microwave
			- Are absorbed by materials within foods and organisms, creating a heating effect
		- Infra-red
			- Are released more by things with higher temperature, so its used to detect heat
		- Visible light
			- Red
			- Orange
			- Yellow
			- Green
			- Cyan
			- Blue
			- Violet
		- Ultra-violet
		- X-rays
		- Gamma rays		
- **Sound wave**
	- Faster vibration = increased frequency = increased pitch
	- Larger vibration = increased amplitude = increased loudness
